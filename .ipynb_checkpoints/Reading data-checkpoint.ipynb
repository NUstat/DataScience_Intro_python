However, an unstructured data can be used to obtain structured data, which in turn can be analyzed. For example, an image can be converted to an array of pixels - which will be structured data.

The operator `loc` uses axis labels (row indices and column names) to subset the data, while `iloc` uses the position of rows or columns, where position has values 0,1,2,3,...and so on, for rows from top to bottom and columns from left to right. In other words, the first row has position 0, the second row has position 1, the third row has position 2, and so on. Similarly, the first column from left has position 0, the second column from left has position 1, the third column from left has position 2, and so on."

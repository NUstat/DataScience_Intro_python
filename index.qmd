# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book is developed for the course STAT303-1 (Data Science with Python-1). The first two chapters of the book are a review of python, and will be covered very quickly. Students are expected to know the contents of these chapters beforehand, or be willing to learn it quickly. Students may use the STAT201 book (https://nustat.github.io/Intro_to_programming_for_data_sci/) to review the python basics required for the STAT303 sequence. The core part of the course begins from the third chapter - *Reading data*. 

Please feel free to let the instructors know in case of any typos/mistakes/general feedback in this book.
